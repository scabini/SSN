# SSN
Code for Spatio-Spectral Networks (SSN), a method to compute color-texture descriptors from images. Preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06446


The code was implemented using Matlab and C++. 

The binary "mexa64" works on Linux 64 bit systems. If you are running a different system you need to compile the "SSN_getFeatureMaps.cpp" source via MEX.
