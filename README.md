# SSN
Code for Spatio-Spectral Networks (SSN), a method to compute color-texture descriptors from images, from the paper "Spatio-spectral networks for color-texture analysis".

The code was implemented using Matlab and C++. The binary "mexa64" works on Linux 64 bit systems, while "mexw64" is Windows 64 bit binaries. If you are running a different system, you may need to compile the C++ sources ".cpp" using MEX:
```
mex('SSN_getFeatureMaps.cpp')
```

## Usage

  * Given a pixel matrix representing an 'image' and a maximum radius 'rn' for neighboring pixel analysis, call the main function SSN:  
  ```
  features = SSN(image, rn)
 ```
  * It works either with 3d matrices (i.e., color images) or 2d matrices (grayscale). However, notice that the method was developed for color images (see the paper).
